## 1. Overview:

- Discussion on the overlap between internal enhancements needed by PGA and previously discussed enhancements.
- Focus on how these enhancements integrate with the proposals by ESRI and others.

## 2. Technical Enhancements and Proposals:

- GIS Enhancements:
    - Removal of glue job to reduce processing time.
    - Introduction of EC2 changes.
    - Reduction in data processing time from approx. 8 minutes to 3 minutes in typical scenarios.
    - Trigger job implementation for S3 bucket file processing.
- Big Data Toolkit (BDT) and Spark Upgrades:
    - Upgrade from Spark 2 to Spark 3.
    - Future plans to upgrade EC2 BDT versions.
    - Focus on maintaining current FGDP generation process due to downstream application impacts.

## 3. Performance and Latency Improvements:

- Achieved latency reduction in GIS big data toolkit from 3-8 minutes to 2-5 minutes.
- ESRI processing time consistent at 2-5 minutes.
- Informatica aiming to reduce processing to 8 minutes.
- Anticipated future improvements to further reduce these times.

## 4. Collaboration and Support Requirements:

- Discussion of support needed from ESRI for upcoming changes.
- Proposal for exploring alternative output formats and their impact on GIS and ESRI systems.
- Emphasis on collaborative exploration for optimal output.

## 5. Next Steps and Action Items:

- Agreement on the validity of proposed work and need for further testing.
- Plan to hold follow-up sessions to clarify and confirm the scope of work.
- Discussion of coordination across teams for efficient implementation and testing of changes.

## 6. Closing Remarks:

- Emphasis on internal coordination and planning for future enhancements.
- Scheduling of next meeting to finalize task list and process for project activities.
